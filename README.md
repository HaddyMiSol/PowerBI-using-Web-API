# HIV Daily Report Monitoring Dashboard-using-Web-API!
## Overview
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard that leverages the DHIS2 web API as its data source.  Data is extracted from DHIS2 via the API and loaded into Power BI, where Power Query is used for data cleaning, manipulation, and restructuring.  The dashboard provides a range of analyses, including an indicator summary report, trend analysis, concurrence analysis between indicators, an accountability matrix, and target achievement monitoring, among other features.

Beyond the project's striking visuals, its most compelling feature was the automation of recurring processes.  Specifically, it addressed the dynamic recalculations required by period changes (e.g., quarterly shifts) and implemented functions that adapt their behavior based on specific conditions.
## DAX formulas used 
  - Date and Time functions such as TODAY(), YEAR(), MONTH(), DAY(), DATEDIFF()
  - Logical functions such as IF(), AND(), OR(), SWITCH()
  - Text Functions such as CONCATENATE(), LEFT(), RIGHT()
  - Calculations functions such as CALCULATE(), DIVIDE()
  - Aggregation functions such as SUM(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), DISTINCTCOUNT()
  - Information functions such as ISBLANK(), ISNUMBER()
  - Time Intelligence function such as SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR()
## Data Cleaning/Restructuring done in PowerQuery
  - Text Manipulation such as Text.Replace, Text.BeforeDelimiter, Text.AfterDelimiter, Text.StartsWith, Text.EndsWith, Text.Contains, Text.Split, Text.Combine, 
    Text.PadStart, Text.PadEnd
  - Date and Time Manipulations such as Date.AddDays, Date.AddMonths, Date.AddYears, Date.FromText, DateTime.FromText, Date.Year, Date.Month, Date.Day
  - Data Type conversion such as Table.TransformColumnTypes
  - Table Manipulations such as Table.NestedJoin, Table.Merge, Table.DuplicateColumn, Table.AddColumn, Table.RenameColumns, Table.RemoveColumns, Table.Sort,     
    Table.SelectRows, Table.ReorderColumns, Table.SplitColumn, Table.ReplaceValue, Table.Pivot, Table.Unpivot
  - Creating reuseable functions
